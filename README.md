# Spotify Marshal
This project allows the automation of Spotify playlists for a user.

The idea is all playlists can be derived from a user's library. Some of the playlist types to be included will be:
- Genres
- Year of release
- Recently added
- More that haven't occurred to me yet...

<br>

*Note:*
Probably worth mentioning this is my first ever Python project so let's see how it goes...

<br>

## Running locally
```sh
pyenv install # or whatever Python version manager you use
pip install -r requirements.txt
python .
```
